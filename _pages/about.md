Welcome to my website! I made this to centralize my projects and the associated publications and conferences. In addition to my main work, there are many small projects that often don't make it into publication, or stay behind the scenes, so I want to keep track of them here as well! And maybe they might even help others solve similar problems. This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
